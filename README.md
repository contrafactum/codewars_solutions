My solutions for Codewars problems

This repository contains my solutions for Codewars problems I train myself on.

Mostly Python, but there will be some other languages featured, too.

1. problem: array_diff.py. In this file, there is a simple function, array_diff(a,b), which returns the set-theoretical subtraction a \ b, where a and b are both Python lists. it also checks for base cases such as empty sets, etc.

2. problem: count_bits.py. In this file, there's a function that counts the high bits (a.k.a. the 1s) in the binary representation of an input integer.

3. problem: descending_order.py. In this file, the function essentially rearranges the digits of the input nonnegative integer to create the highest possible number.

4. problem: persistence.py. It contains a function that calculates and returns the multiplicative persistence of a positive integer. More details in said file.

5. problem: split_strings.py. This has a function which splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').
