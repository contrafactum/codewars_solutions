My solutions for Codewars problems

This repository contains my solutions for Codewars problems I train myself on.

Mostly Python, but there will be some other languages featured, too.

1. problem: array_diff.py. In this file, there is a simple function, array_diff(a,b), which returns the set-theoretical subtraction a \ b, where a and b are both Python lists. it also checks for base cases such as empty sets, etc.

2. problem: count_bits.py. In this file, there's a function that counts the high bits (a.k.a. the 1s) in the binary representation of an input integer.
